            <H3>Introduction</H3>
            <p> Take a moment to explore the intriguing visualizations below.
                <br><br>
                As your eyes move across the graphs, what catches your attention first?</p>
            <div id="overview">
                <svg id="yes_plot_svg_overview"></svg>
                <svg id="no_plot_svg_overview"></svg>
            </div>
            <p>At first glance, you might be struck by the stark contrast between the two.</p>
            <p>The left chart seems to
                suggest a startling proposition: individuals who engage in higher levels of exercise are more likely to
                meet an untimely end. This notion challenges our ingrained beliefs about the unequivocal benefits of
                physical activity for longevity. Could it be that our dedication to fitness carries unforeseen risks,
                leading us down a path towards mortality?
            </p>
            <p>
                Meanwhile, on the right, a different narrative unfolds. Here, the focus shifts to cholesterol levels—a
                factor often overlooked in discussions about exercise and health. The chart suggests that it is
                individuals with elevated cholesterol who are more susceptible to mortality, regardless of their
                exercise habits. This revelation prompts us to reconsider the simplistic assumption that exercise alone
                is the key to a longer life.
            </p>
            <p>
                These visualizations, crafted from the same dataset, challenge us to confront a contentious truth: the
                relationship between exercise, cholesterol, and mortality is far more complex than we once believed. As
                we delve deeper into this paradox, we are compelled to rethink our preconceived notions about health,
                longevity, and the choices we make in pursuit of a better life.
            </p>
            <p align="justify">This topic delves into various controversial narratives surrounding heart health and its
                relationship
                with exercise habits, cholesterol, and other factors.

                By exploring these different attributes and their implications for heart health, this topic can uncover
                diverse perspectives and generate discussions about the most effective strategies for promoting
                cardiovascular well-being in individuals and communities.

            <p class="caption" align="center" id="left_plot_caption"></p>
            <p>This visualization challenges conventional wisdom by depicting the frequency of exercise (number of days
                per week) against weight, revealing a surprising trend: individuals who exercised more frequently in a
                particular weight range had a
                higher incidence of heart attack fatalities. Interestingly, there appears to be minimal correlation
                between exercise frequency and weight, suggesting that the observed link between exercise and heart
                attack fatalities may be biased solely by the frequency of exercise.</p>

            <p>In contrast to the previous visualization, this plot illuminates the interplay between cholesterol levels
                and weight, with red denoting individuals who died of heart attacks and green depicting survivors.
                Remarkably, it suggests that those who succumbed to heart attacks often had higher cholesterol levels,
                challenging the prevailing belief that exercise alone dictates heart health outcomes.

                Additionally, a notable observation is the robust positive correlation between weight and cholesterol
                levels. This finding implies that weight drive cholesterol levels, thus establishing cholesterol as
                a significant factor contributing to heart attack fatalities.</p>

            <h3>Rhetoric/Framing Techniques</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Y-Axis Scale Representation:</strong>
                    In the left plot, the y-axis scale depicts the average exercise per week,
                    offering insights into physical activity levels. Conversely, the right plot's y-axis scale
                    represents
                    cholesterol levels, providing information on cardiovascular health markers.

                <li><strong>Color Coding:</strong> The choice of colors serves to highlight distinct outcomes in both
                    plots. Red
                    signifies
                    individuals who succumbed to heart attacks, emphasizing adverse health events, while green
                    represents
                    those who remain alive, contrasting positive outcomes.

                <li><strong>Bubble Size Significance:</strong> The size of bubbles in both plots corresponds to the
                    number of individuals
                    sharing identical data points, such as average exercise/week or cholesterol levels, at specific
                    weight.
                    This visual element enhances comprehension by illustrating data density and distribution within the
                    dataset.
            </ol>
            <h5> Left Chart Rhetoric/Framing techniques overview: </h5>
            <p> The left chart employs framing techniques such as selective highlighting and color symbolism to promote
                a specific viewpoint. By using red to represent individuals who died of heart attacks, it creates a
                visually striking contrast that immediately draws attention to the perceived association between
                frequent exercise and adverse health outcomes. The varying size of bubbles depicts the frequency of
                individuals of that weight with the same exercise per week, enhancing the visual impact and reinforcing
                the
                narrative of exercise frequency's potential role in heart health.</p>
            <h5> Right Chart Rhetoric/Framing techniques overview: </h5>
            <p> On the right chart, framing effects are utilized to challenge the prevailing narrative regarding the
                relationship between exercise and heart health. By highlighting individuals with high cholesterol levels
                who experienced heart attacks, the visualization aims to shift the focus away from exercise as the sole
                determinant of cardiovascular risk. The varying size of bubbles depicts the frequency of individuals of
                that weight with the same cholesterol level, adding depth to the analysis and underscoring the
                complexity
                of factors influencing heart health. This framing technique leverages the concept of counterframing
                discussed in the Hullman paper, offering an alternative perspective that challenges conventional wisdom
                and encourages critical reflection.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>

                The juxtaposition of the two visualizations challenges our preconceived notions about the relationship
                between exercise, cholesterol, and mortality. Initially, the left plot seemingly supports the notion
                that individuals engaging in higher levels of exercise are more prone to untimely deaths. However, upon
                closer examination of the second plot, a different narrative emerges—one that highlights the
                significance of cholesterol levels in determining cardiovascular outcomes.</p>

            <p>Contrary to the initial interpretation, the data suggests that individuals who succumbed to heart
                attacks tended to have higher cholesterol levels, regardless of their exercise habits. This revelation
                prompts us to reassess the simplistic belief that excessive exercise is inherently detrimental to heart
                health. Instead, it underscores the multifaceted nature of cardiovascular risk factors and the
                importance of comprehensive health management strategies.</p>

            <p>By analyzing the same dataset using different pairs of attributes with identical visualization type, we
                unveil contrasting perspectives that
                lead to divergent conclusions. While the first plot suggests a causal relationship between exercise
                frequency and mortality, the second plot reveals the critical role of cholesterol levels in influencing
                cardiovascular outcomes. This illustrates how visual representations can shape our understanding of
                complex phenomena and emphasizes the need for critical interpretation in data analysis.</p>

            <p>In essence, these visualizations serve as a compelling example of how nuanced exploration can debunk
                prevailing myths and challenge conventional wisdom. By leveraging data visualization techniques
                effectively, we can uncover hidden truths and foster a deeper understanding of complex issues,
                ultimately leading to more informed decision-making and improved health outcomes.
